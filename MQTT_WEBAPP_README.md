- üì° **MQTT integration** using the existing mqtt_subscriber.py configuration
- üñºÔ∏è **Image message support** with automatic base64 decoding and display
- üîç **Chess Recognition Pipeline** - Full integration with ChessCog recognition system
- üìä **JSON message formatting** with syntax highlighting
- üîÑ **Auto-scroll functionality** with toggle control
- üìà **Connection status monitoring** and message statistics
- üßπ **Clean UI** with message categorization and timestamps
- üéØ **Multiple Image Views** - Original, corner detection, and board analysis
- ‚ôüÔ∏è **Live Chess Analysis** - Board state, FEN notation, and piece detection

## Files Created

1. `mqtt_live_webapp.py` - Main web application
2. `mqtt_test_publisher.py` - Test publisher for sending sample messages
3. `MQTT_WEBAPP_README.md` - This documentation

## Setup

The webapp uses the same MQTT configuration as your existing `mqtt_subscriber.py`, so ensure your `.env` file contains:

```env
MQTT_URL=your_mqtt_broker_url
MQTT_USERNAME=your_username
MQTT_PASSWORD=your_password  
MQTT_TOPIC=your_topic
# Board rotation for camera orientation  
ROTATE_BOARD_270=true  # Actually applies 180¬∞ rotation
# ... other MQTT settings
```

## Usage

### Running the Webapp

1. **Development Mode** (recommended for testing):
   ```bash
   python mqtt_live_webapp.py
   ```

2. **Production Mode** (more stable, no debug features):
   ```bash
   python mqtt_live_webapp.py --production
   # or set FLASK_ENV=production
   ```

The webapp will start on `http://localhost:5001`

## Chess Recognition Setup

The webapp includes full integration with the ChessCog chess recognition pipeline. If the recognition modules are available, images will be automatically processed to detect chess boards, corners, and pieces.

### Requirements for Chess Recognition

The webapp will automatically detect if chess recognition is available. For full functionality, ensure:

1. **ChessCog modules** are properly installed and accessible
2. **Model files** are available in the `models://` directory
3. **GPU support** (optional but recommended for better performance)

If chess recognition is not available, the webapp will still function normally but only display original images without analysis.

### Recognition Features

When an image is received via MQTT:

1. **Automatic Processing**: Image is immediately analyzed for chess content
2. **Corner Detection**: Identifies chess board boundaries and perspective
3. **Piece Recognition**: Detects and classifies individual chess pieces
4. **Board State**: Generates FEN notation and board visualization
5. **Multiple Views**: Displays original, corner detection, and board state
6. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when no chess board is detected
7. **Smart Detection**: Distinguishes between "no board found" vs "processing errors"
8. **Adaptive Parameters**: Automatically tries different detection parameters for various cameras
9. **Camera Compatibility**: Works with different image sizes, lighting, and camera characteristics
10. **Original Image YOLO**: Uses full-resolution original images for YOLO detection (better accuracy)
11. **Professional Board Rendering**: Uses chess.svg for beautiful, standard chess board visualization

### Adaptive Corner Detection

The webapp includes an intelligent parameter adjustment system that automatically tries different corner detection settings when the default parameters fail. This solves the common "RANSAC produced no viable results" error with different cameras.

**Parameter Sets Automatically Tested:**
1. **Default Parameters**: Standard settings for most cameras
2. **High Sensitivity**: For low-contrast or dim images (lower thresholds)
3. **Low Sensitivity**: For noisy or high-contrast images (higher thresholds)  
4. **Maximum Relaxed**: Last resort with very permissive settings

**Benefits:**
- **Multi-Camera Support**: Works with different camera sensors and lenses
- **Lighting Adaptation**: Handles various lighting conditions automatically
- **Resolution Independence**: Adapts to different image sizes (1600x1200, etc.)
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows which parameter set was successful

### Original Image YOLO Detection

For YOLO-based piece recognition, the webapp uses the **"Use Original Image"** approach instead of warped images:

**Benefits:**
- **Higher Resolution**: Uses full camera resolution (e.g., 1200x1600) instead of downscaled warped images
- **Better Accuracy**: More detailed piece features for improved recognition
- **No Warping Artifacts**: Avoids distortion from perspective correction
- **More Detections**: Typically finds 2-3x more pieces than warped approach

**Technical Details:**
- Detects corners on resized image for efficiency
- Scales corners back to original image coordinates
- Runs YOLO detection on full-resolution original image
- **Uses perspective transformation** to map detections to chess squares accurately
- **Corner-based mapping** instead of flawed auto-detection from piece positions
- **Automatic 180¬∞ rotation** for camera orientation
- Inspired by approaches from [chess_state_recognition](https://github.com/sta314/chess_state_recognition#) project

### Board Rotation for Camera Orientation

The webapp automatically rotates the detected board state by **180¬∞** to match camera orientations.

**Configuration:**
```env
ROTATE_BOARD_270=true   # Enable 180¬∞ rotation (default)
ROTATE_BOARD_270=false  # Disable rotation
```

**How it works:**
- **Original Detection**: YOLO detects pieces based on camera perspective
- **Perspective Mapping**: Maps pieces to chess squares using corner detection
- **180¬∞ Rotation**: Rotates the entire board state to match logical chess orientation
- **Final FEN**: Outputs the rotated board state for correct chess notation

**Rotation Formula:** `(file, rank) ‚Üí (7-file, 7-rank)`
- Example: Queen at g1 ‚Üí Queen at b8 after rotation

**UI Indicators:**
- **Activity Feed**: Shows "(180¬∞ rotated)" in detection messages
- **Info Overlay**: Displays "üîÑ Rotated 180¬∞ for camera" status  
- **Analysis Panel**: Shows both rotated and original FEN for debugging

### Testing with Sample Messages

Run the test publisher to send sample messages:

```bash
python mqtt_test_publisher.py
```

This will send various test messages including:
- Simple text messages
- JSON messages with structured data
- Chess-related messages
- Image messages (small test images)
- Periodic status updates

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main webapp interface
- `GET /events` - Server-Sent Events stream for real-time updates
- `GET /status` - JSON endpoint with connection status and statistics
- `GET /messages` - JSON endpoint with recent message history
- `POST /test_image` - Test image recognition with adaptive parameters (for debugging camera issues)

## Troubleshooting

### MQTT Reconnection Issues

The webapp has been configured to minimize reconnection issues:
- Uses `use_reloader=False` in development mode
- Implements connection locking and cleanup
- Conservative keepalive and reconnection settings
- Proper cleanup on shutdown

If you still experience frequent reconnections:
1. Try production mode: `python mqtt_live_webapp.py --production`
2. Check your network connection stability
3. Verify MQTT broker settings and limits

### Connection Problems

- Ensure your `.env` file has correct MQTT credentials
- Check that the MQTT broker is accessible
- Verify SSL/TLS settings match your broker configuration

## Image Message Format

For image messages, send JSON in this format:
```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "image": "base64_encoded_image_data",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-21T10:00:00",
  "description": "Optional description"
}
```

The webapp will automatically decode and display the image.

## Development

The webapp is built with:
- Flask for the web framework
- Server-Sent Events for real-time communication
- paho-mqtt for MQTT client functionality
- Threading for concurrent MQTT and web operations

To extend functionality:
1. Modify message processing in `MQTTHandler.on_message()`
2. Update the HTML template for UI changes
3. Add new API endpoints as needed

## Performance

- Message queue limited to 100 messages to prevent memory issues
- Images are automatically saved to `images/` directory
- Disconnected SSE clients are automatically cleaned up
- MQTT client uses clean sessions and proper resource cleanup
